#  4-bit ALU Performing Operations Implemented using Verilog HDL
CSE460 Project

In this project, two four-bit inputs are used to conduct five different operations inside the ALU, including RESET, XOR, SUB, NAND, ADD in Quartus using Verilog code. The ALU produces the four-bit result and generates three flags based on the outcome of a given operation: carry,
zero, and sign-flag are observed, verifying the timing diagrams
with the state diagram and expected outcomes.
